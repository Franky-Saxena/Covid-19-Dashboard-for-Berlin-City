# Covid-19 Dashboard for Berlin City

In this project we build a Dashboard which perform the things like:

This dashboard provides daily updates of the 7-day-incidence (number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants), the rolling 7-day-average number of new cases and the raw number of new reported Covid-19 cases. You may select the districts to view and compare.

The data are the latest official figures provided by the Berlin government, sourced from berlin.de.

If you are viewing this on a mobile device, tap > in the top left corner to select district and timescale.

In this Dashboard user can select the districts according to him and number of days of data he wants.

So the Dashboard will show the:
* 7 Day Incidence
* New reported cases - rolling 7 Days Average
* Newly reported Cases Last 30 Days
